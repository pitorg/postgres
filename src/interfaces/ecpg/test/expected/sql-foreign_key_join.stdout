Testing foreign key join parser with <- and -> operators
=========================================================

SELECT (1<-2)::int: result = 0 (should be 0confdefs.h)

Testing valid -> syntax variations:
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 KEY (c3) -> t1 (c1) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 KEY (c3) ->/*comment*/ t1 (c1) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 KEY (c3) /*comment*/-> t1 (c1) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 KEY (c3) /*comment*/->/*comment*/ t1 (c1) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)

Testing valid <- syntax variations:
  SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN t1 KEY (c1) <- t2 (c3) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN t1 KEY (c1) <-/*comment*/ t2 (c3) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN t1 KEY (c1) /*comment*/<- t2 (c3) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)
  SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN t1 KEY (c1) /*comment*/<-/*comment*/ t2 (c3) -- ok (c2=10, c4=30)

Testing that < and - with space are separate operators:
  SELECT (1 < - 2)::int: result = 0 (should be 0)
  SELECT (3 < -1)::int: result = 0 (should be 0)
  SELECT (3<-2)::int: result = 0 (should be 0)
  SELECT (-1 < 1)::int: result = 1 (should be 1)
  SELECT (-3<-2)::int: result = 1 (should be 1)

All parser tests completed successfully!
